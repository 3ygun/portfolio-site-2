# Portfolio Site 2

__Skill Level:__ Beginner

This challenge is designed to exercise some of the more advanced HTML features

## Requirements

The finished product should be an HTML document named `index.html`. You are more than welcome to use your [Portfolio Site exercise](https://github.com/CWDG/portfolio-site) as a starting point.

The `index.html` file should contain:

- Links to the different sections (which will need anchors). You can make a navigation panel or similar, allowing visitors to easily jump to any part of your website.
- An image. It can be of you, your dog, a poster for your favorite movie, whatever.
- A table. You can fill it with your classes and corresponding grades (if you're super proud of them), or any other tabular data.
- Different sections, each in `section` tags.

That's it!
